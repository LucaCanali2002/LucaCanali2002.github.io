    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In this project, I reclassified Ryanair’s financial statements for the years 2022–2024 and built a Power BI report to analyze the main KPIs of profitability, financial stability, and capital structure.</p>

    <h2>Overview Page</h2>
    <p>The introductory page of the report presents a summary of the company’s performance over the three-year period, supported by the main KPIs. Overall, revenues and profitability show a positive and growing trend. Profitability ratios (ROI, ROE, and ROS) indicate very satisfactory performance. The analysis of the charts related to revenues, ROC, and net income confirms an overall improvement, although negative values are observed in 2022 for both ROC and net income. All presented data can be filtered by individual year.</p>

    <h2>Profitability and Financial Structure KPIs</h2>
     <p> This page of the report analyzes the main profitability and financial stability indicators, along with their respective drivers. Profitability is generally very good and growing, especially considering the high competitiveness of the sector. The chart showing the trend of the ratios confirms the negative results recorded in 2022, but also highlights the performance of financial position, which saw a strong increase in 2023 followed by a reduction in 2024. Currently, the company’s financial stability is generally satisfactory; however, the debt ratio should be closely monitored, as it remains at relatively high levels.</p>

    <h2>Financial Position</h2>
        <p> On this final page, we analyze the company’s financial condition. The situation appears less favorable compared to the previous sections, mainly due to high debt levels, particularly short-term debt. Another critical aspect is the operating leverage, which highlights the presence of high fixed costs and, consequently, a higher operational risk. However, it is important to note that, over time, the degree of operating leverage has decreased, indicating an improvement in the management of fixed costs.</p>
